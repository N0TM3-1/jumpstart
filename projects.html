            <ul>
              <li>PathPilot: You need to give commands to a robot but you can't see what you've already told him to do. At the end you click run and the "code" runs and if it fails (doesn't reach goal, dies, whatever) you need to restart completely</li>
              <li>Zeroed: There is a field of numbers and you can place blocks (like these from tetris) and these blocks reduce these numbers. Your goal is to have all the numbers at 0.</li>
              <li>IDK:  Something goes forward and each time you click it turns 90°. You need to navigate it through a maze with spikes, etc.</li>
              <li>All the names and the gameplay for each game might change. I might remove a game or add more games.</li>

            <p>Game Engine: Godot</p>
            <p>Experience: I used Godot for Counterspell 2024 which was around 20hrs of work and Juice for 100hrs. I have a good amount of experience in Godot.</p>
            <p>Other Notes: "This project took around 100hrs and was originally going to be submitted to Neighborhood, but since its canceled, I would like to submit it here. I have the devlogs for the game. I worked with @Kayla on this game. I'll probably also try to submit it to summer of making."</p>
