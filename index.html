        <h3>1. Plan your Game </h3>
        <p>Choose what kind of game you want to make (puzzle, platformer, fighting, simulation, racing...) Think about the features you want to add, the theme you want your game to have, and what the actual gameplay will be like. </p>
        <p>Pick a game engine to use. If this is your first time, use <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a>. If you have prior game dev experience, you can use <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>.</p>
        <p>If you need a start, go to <href="http://jumpstartv1.hackclub.com/" target="_blank">Jumpstart V1's website</href> and there are many very comprehensive beginner-friendly guides to get you started on making a platformer in Godot.</p>
        <p>Once you have an idea for your game, post a message in the #jumpstart channel with a one-liner for your game, a couple features you want to add, the game engine you will be using, if you've done game dev before, and any other ideas about your game that you have.</p>

        <h3>2. Build your Game</h3>
        <p>Spend 35 hours building a game!

        <p>Once you hit 10 hours and 20 hours, you must post a message in #jumpstart with your Github repository linked, a screen-recording of your gameplay, a list of what features you added, what the most challenging thing was, and what you are planning on adding next. </p>
